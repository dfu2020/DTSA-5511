## Project Summary
In this project, I will be using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to predict Rainfall and the amount of Rainfall using weather observations from Australia.

I will be perform the following tasks:
 1. Perform EDA and data cleaning from the given weather observation.
 2. Build a simple RNN Sequential model for predicting whether it will rain (or not).
 3. Build a LSTM model to predict the amount of rainfall based on a timeseries of historical observations.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of RNN on weather prediction.
